# 2026-01-08 - Pilot Deck Bootstrap

## Progress
- Created pilot-deck directory structure
- Initialized GitHub repo bilawalriaz/pilot-deck
- Set up project template and initial todos

## Decisions
- Using Discord as primary notification channel
- Notion integration scaffolded for later implementation
- Off-VPS logging via GitHub for audit trail

## Next Steps
- Discord webhook configuration
- Notification scripts (discord-lib.sh, notify.sh, health-check.sh, daily-digest.sh)
- Session start/end scripts

## Notes
First day building out the command and control system. Structure feels solid - simple, git-based, off-VPS backup built in.
